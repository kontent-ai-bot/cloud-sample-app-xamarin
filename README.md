# Kentico Cloud sample Xamarin application
[<img align="right" src="/img/android.png" alt="Android sample app" />](/img/android.png)

This project demonstrates how you can use [Kentico Cloud Delivery SDK](https://github.com/Kentico/delivery-sdk-net) (or any other Kentico Cloud SDK for .NET) in a cross-platform Xamarin application. It displays content from a Sample Project that demonstrates Kentico Cloud features and best practices. This fully featured project contains marketing content for Dancing Goat â€“ an imaginary chain of coffee shops. If you don't have your own Sample Project, any admin of a Kentico Cloud subscription [can generate one](https://app.kenticocloud.com/sample-project-generator).
